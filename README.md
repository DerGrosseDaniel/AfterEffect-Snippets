# AfterEffect-Snippets

random snippets of AfterEffects scrips and expressions

ideas wich would be usefull:
- Take all selected images, put in comp to cursor, all 1 frames long, one after another
- select Items in AE project, select folder with proxy and set all proxies which have an identical named proxy file
- create a collection of filmed cameramovements which were 3d tracked an can be used for video footage to give it a realistic handheld motion
- 3D Camera Tracker -> DepthMap -> Blur in Abhänigkeit der Map -> künstlicher Fokus setzen
- rumspielen mit valueAtTime()
- Settings Script (Script witch lists all Expression Control Effects from Settings Comp and makes applying easy)

There will be no list with file discriptions. You have to read the file names to get the purpose and then open it to get more infos in the comments.
